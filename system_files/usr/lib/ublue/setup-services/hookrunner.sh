#!/usr/bin/env -S bash
# hookrunner.sh — single source of truth for the ublue-*-setup hook dispatchers.
#
# /usr/bin/ublue-system-setup, /usr/bin/ublue-user-setup and
# /usr/bin/ublue-privileged-setup are the same dispatcher three times over: read
# a directory out of /etc/ublue-os/setup.json (falling back to a compiled-in
# default), honour the `verbose` flag, then run every file in that directory
# with bash. The only per-service variation is the config key and the default
# directory.
#
# Both halves of that dispatcher live here so a change to hook discovery,
# config parsing, or ordering lands on all three services at once. The entry
# points in /usr/bin are thin wrappers that supply their key and default and
# nothing else.
#
# The library path is overridable via $HOOKRUNNER so the wrappers can be
# exercised from a source checkout, matching the $LIBSETUP convention already
# used by the setup hooks in /usr/share/ublue-os/*-setup.hooks.d.

# get_config <jq-query> <fallback>
#
# Read a value out of $SETUP_CONFIG_FILE (default /etc/ublue-os/setup.json).
# Returns <fallback> when the file is missing, unreadable, unparseable, or when
# the query resolves to JSON null.
