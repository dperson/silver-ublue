## sysctl settings are defined through files in
## /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/.
##
## Vendors settings live in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/.
## To override a whole file, create a new file with the same in
## /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there. To override
## only specific settings, add a file with a lexically later
## name in /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there.
##
## For more information, see sysctl.conf(5) and sysctl.d(5).
